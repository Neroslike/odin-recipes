        <li>2 1/2 cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups pre-cooked  white corn meal</li>

    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir water and salt together in a bowl. Gradually stir corn meal into water with your fingers until mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 golf ball-size balls and pat each one into a patty about 3/8-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, cook corn patties in hot oil until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
